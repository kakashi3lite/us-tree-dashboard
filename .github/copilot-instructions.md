# Copilot Instructions

- Use **Python 3.11** with Dash and Flask.
- Follow PEP8, add type hints and docstrings.
- Prefer small, pure functions.
- Run `pytest` before committing.
- Format with `black` and `isort`; lint with `flake8` when adding workflows.
- Avoid committing secrets; use `.env.example` for new variables.
- For docs, update `PROJECT_BRIEF.md` and `CODEMAP.md` when structure changes.
