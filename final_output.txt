C:\Users\Swanand\CascadeProjects\us-tree-dashboard\app.py:6: DeprecationWarning: Parsing dates involving a day of month without a year specified is ambiguious
and fails to parse leap day. The default behavior will change in Python 3.15
to either always raise an exception or to use a different default year (TBD).
To avoid trouble, add a specific year to the input & format.
