## üì¶ Installation

### Prerequisites

- Docker and Docker Compose
- Git
- 4GB RAM minimum (8GB recommended)
- 20GB free disk space
- OpenAI API key for AI features

### Quick Start

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/kakashi3lite/us-tree-dashboard.git
   cd us-tree-dashboard
   ```

2. Set up environment variables:
   ```bash
   copy .env.example .env  # Windows
   cp .env.example .env    # Linux/Mac
   ```
   
3. Configure your OpenAI API key in .env:
   ```
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```

4. Start the main dashboard:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build -d
   ```

5. (Optional) Start the Jupyter environment for analysis:
   ```bash
   docker-compose -f docker-compose-jupyter.yml up --build -d
   ```

### Environment Setup

The project uses Docker containers with all dependencies pre-configured. However, if you need to modify environment variables:
1. Edit `.env` to configure:
   - Mapbox API token
   - Database credentials
   - Other service configurations

## üöÄ Running the Application

### Google Colab
For quick exploration and analysis:

1. Open our Colab notebook:
   [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/kakashi3lite/us-tree-dashboard/blob/main/notebooks/colab_analysis.ipynb)

2. The notebook will automatically:
   - Clone the repository
   - Install dependencies
   - Set up the GDAL environment
   - Load sample data

3. Run the cells to perform:
   - Geographic analysis
   - ML predictions
   - Environmental impact assessment

### Local Development
Start the dashboard using Docker Compose:
```bash
docker-compose up
```
Open your browser and navigate to: `http://127.0.0.1:8050`

### Testing
Install dependencies and run the unit tests:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
pytest
```

### Production Deployment
1. Set environment variables for production
2. Use Gunicorn to run the application:
   ```bash
   gunicorn app:server --preload --workers 4
   ```
